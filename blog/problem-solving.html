            <u class="sub-head">A Time I Was Blocked on a Simple Problem</u>
          </h3>
          <p>
            I was blocked on the task of Capitalizing the first letter of every
            word. While using the in-built split method, I mistakenly added
            quotes with out space. There must obviously be a space in front of
            every word.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Debugging with console.log</li>
            <li>
              I explained the problem aloud as if I were teaching someone else.
              I only do this in my own space. If I'am with others, I would write
              it down on a paper instead. it helped me to clarify and refine my
              own thoughts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Either I stepped away from the problem for 15 minutes or I moved
              to next task and then came back to it later.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>How I Felt:</p>
          <p>
            I felt embarrassed and frustrated at first. I kept wondering why I
            was stuck on such basic things. I was stuck longer than I expected.
            However, Once I figured it out, it boosted my confidence and
            satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>What I learned:</p>
          <p>
            I realized the importance of debugging techniques. There's no need
            to get frustrated.It's best to Take a break and come back.

            <u class="sub-head">A Time I Elegantly Solved a Problem</u>
          </h3>
          <p>
            I was working on a javascript task where I needed to filter a large
            string and remove the word 'buzz' wherever it appeared. I wasn't
            sure how to solve the problem. so I split the task into smaller
            parts and turned to google for guidance.
          </p>
          <p>problem-solving techniques:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To tackle the issue, I splitted the problem into smaller
              individual tasks and Searched using the keyword. Then joined the
              ideas ,I've collected from google.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>How I Felt:</p>
          <p>
            I felt uncertain about how to approach the task. But, once I started
            to research and applied the things I got, I gained confidence to
            troubleshoot. it was satisfying to see the code work as expected.
          </p>
          <p>What I learned:</p>
          <p>
            I learned the value of proper search and how to leverage built-in
            JavaScript methods to solve problems efficiently.

            <u class="sub-head">Reflecting on Problem-Solving Techniques</u>
          </h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> I feel confident using pseudocode.It
              helps me break down complex problems into smaller, manageable
              steps and refines my thoughts and planning process.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Trying something:</strong> I'm confident in trying
              different approaches to see what works. I enjoy experimenting with
              new things and exploring creative solutions.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Rubber Ducky Method:</strong> This is a simple yet
              powerful technique I frequently use. I explain the problem aloud
              as if I were teaching someone else, which helps reinforce and
              refine my own thoughts. However, I usually do this only when I'm
              in my own space. When I'm with others, I prefer to write down the
              issue on paper instead.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Reading error messages:</strong> I'm quite confident in
              reading error messages. They help me understand the problem and
              locate the part of the file where the error has occurred. However,
              some error messages can still be cryptic. I'm continuously
              improving at understanding and interpreting them.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Console.logging:</strong>I feel very confident using
              console.log() as a debugging tool. I use it to understand the flow
              of code and inspect the values held by variables, arrays, and
              methods. It helps me identify where something goes wrong or when
              the code behaves differently from my expectations.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Googling:</strong>I think I'm quite good at searching
              using keywords. It helps me save time and keeps me from
              unnecessary wandering.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong>I feel somewhat
              confident asking my peers for help. However, sometimes my inner
              voice tells me to figure it out myself, asking, "What would you do
              if there was no one to ask?" I always make an effort to search and
              solve the problem on my own first. However, when I feel frustrated
              with an issue, I definitely reach out for help.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong>I'm confident in asking
              coaches for help. If I'm stuck, I seek and accept the support
              available to me.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong>I'm
              confident in reflecting on my own process. It helps me identify my
              activities and thought patterns. It's like a filter for me,
              allowing me to refine and clarify my observations.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>
            <u class="sub-head"
              >Reflection on a Time I Was Reluctant to Ask for Help:</u
            >
          </h3>
          <p>
            There was a time when I was working on an array related task in kata
            challenge. I was stuck on a bug and I spent a lot of time to figure
            it out.I hesitated to ask for help. I was reluctant because I didn't
            want to seem like I couldn't solve the problem on my own.My inner
            voice kept telling me to push through and figure it out
            independently as I didn't want to appear inefficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking back, I realize that,not asking for help sooner, I wasted
            lot of time and energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next time, I would try to reach out sooner. Seeking guidance often
            leads to clearer solutions. It's okay to not have all the answers,
            and by asking, we learn through teamwork.
