          </h3>
          <p>
            I've learned that I can achieve better results through
            <strong>collaboration</strong>. By working together, we can overcome
            our limitations and leverage our individual abilities. While I
            prefer to plan and be prepared, I've realized that, beyond that, we
            need the ability to embrace uncertainty and adapt. I've realized
            that when faced with challenges, I tend to question my ability to
            cope, but in truth, I'm much more resilient than I initially
            believed.I noticed that my ego sometimes makes me reluctant to ask
            for help.Rather, it's a strength that allows me to learn faster and
            achieve better results.

          <p>
            Values, empathy, and self-awareness play a crucial role in
            programming and beyond. As the saying goes, sharing is caring—not
            just when it comes to material things, but also ideas. Being kind
            and empathetic to others, understanding their strengths and
            limitations, and offering encouragement can create a more supportive
            and empowering environment.Values guide our actions and decisions,
            influencing how we approach problem-solving and teamwork. When
            working in a team, collaboration is essential. Self-awareness helps
            us managing emotions and adapting to challenges. Fostering better
            communication and teamwork. Together, these values enable us to
            understand and support one another, ultimately leading to stronger,
            more effective learning and programming experiences.

            >
          </h3>
          <p>
            The most surprising aspect is that technical competency alone is not
            enough to succeed as a programmer. Beyond coding skills, strong
            human skills—such as communication, empathy, and self-awareness—play
            a crucial role. Effective communication fosters the exchange of
            ideas, strengthens collaboration, and helps in understanding others.
            Additionally, being aware of our own emotions and those of others is
            essential for managing relationships and working effectively in a
            team.

              Even though I had good family support to look after my baby, it
              was still challenging. Sometimes, I questioned whether this was
              the right time to do this—if not now, then when? I couldn't find a
              perfect time, but I believe I did my best to cover everything at
              least once. During difficult moments, I reminded myself that I'm
              not the first person to pursue something while caring for a baby.
              I want to dedicate my time to both studying and being near my
              baby, and I am doing my best to balance both.So far, I believe I
              have been successful in my journey.

              However, once I started, I was able to work through it and strive
              for a good result.

            Successful developers do more than just write code—they communicate,
            collaborate, and adapt. The ability to express ideas clearly and
            articulate problems and solutions is essential for teamwork. Web
            development is not a solo effort; working effectively with other
            developers, designers, and team leads is crucial.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tech employers don't just seek top grades or perfect code. They
            value individuals who contribute positively to team culture. Strong
            problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and adaptability help
            developers navigate the fast-paced evolution of technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building great applications requires understanding user needs. Great
            applications are built with users in mind. Developers must think
            like both testers and clients, ensuring clarity in communication and
            creating user-friendly experiences. Effective collaboration and
            idea-sharing enable teams to innovate and produce better
            products.Strong human skills—like active listening, empathy, and
            adaptability—help bridge the gap between technology and real-world
            needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mastering human skills alongside technical skills makes developers
            more effective, adaptable, and valuable in the industry.

          <p>
            Not at all, The time I spent to studying human skills learning here,
            never felt like a waste of time. Technical skills alone are not
            enough for a programmer. Writing clean, efficient code is essential,
            However being able to communicate, collaborate, and adapt is what
            truly sets a great developer apart. The life of a developer is not
            an isolated one, they need to attend daily stand-up meetings,
            discuss project concepts, address challenges, and collaborate with
            team leaders, co-developers, testers, clients, and end users.
            Effective communication is key to handling all these interactions.
            It's not a one way process.
          </p>
          <p>
            A developer must be able to articulate ideas clearly, express
            thoughts effectively, and understand other's perspectives.I believe
            that, these skills enhances teamwork, problem-solving and overall
            project success.
