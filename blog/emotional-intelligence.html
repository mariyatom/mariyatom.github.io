          <h2>Emotional-intelligence (EQ)</h2>
          <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence (EQ) refers to a persons ability to perceive,
            control, and influence emotions in oneself and others, which helps
            in building strong relationships,Controlling one's own
            emotions,making thoughtful decisions, and handling social
            interactions effectively.
          </p>
          <h3>How is EQ Different from IQ?</h3>
          <p>
            EQ (Emotional Quotient) and IQ (Intelligence Quotient) are distinct
            but complementary measures of human abilities. EQ focuses on
            emotional competency, assessing one's ability to identify, control,
            and use emotions effectively. It impacts motivation, empathy,
            self-awareness, self-control, and relationships, playing a crucial
            role in social interactions and personal well-being.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, IQ emphasizes cognitive abilities, measuring
            skills like processing information, reasoning, memory, and
            knowledge. It influences academic performance, expertise, logic, and
            critical thinking, and is central to problem-solving and
            intellectual pursuits.
          </p>
          <h3>Why is Emotional Intelligence (EQ) Important?</h3>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence plays a critical role in shaping our personal
            and professional lives.Factors such as temperament, upbringing,
            cultural influences, and trauma can also significantly impact a
            person's EQ. It encourages us to put ourselves in other's shoes,
            considering how they might feel in a given situation. This practice
            of empathy fosters stronger connections and understanding in
            relationships. People with high EQ communicate better, manage
            stress, resolve conflicts, and collaborate effectively in teams. EQ
            fosters leadership, empathy, and resilience, which are vital for
            building trust, inspiring others, and navigating social dynamics in
            the workplace and beyond.
          </p>
          <p>
            EQ can be developed through practice and self-awareness. Pay
            attention to your emotions, triggers, and reactions in different
            situations. Developing empathy is also key; try to understand
            others' perspectives and emotions. Another important thing is
            self-awareness.Observing your emotions and reflecting on what
            triggers them helps enhance this skill. Keeping a journal is an
            excellent practice to gain deeper insights into your emotional
            patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Approaching situations with openness and withholding judgment is
            another vital aspect of EQ. This mindset helps us better understand
            others and consider diverse perspectives and ideas. Focusing on the
            present moment, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about
            the future, is crucial for developing emotional awareness. This
            mindfulness strengthens our ability to understand and manage our
            feelings.
