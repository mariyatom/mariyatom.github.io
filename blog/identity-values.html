            A situation where I made an ethical decision, how I weighed up the
            values involved in that decision, the decision I made, and how I
            reflect on the decision now.
          </h3>
          <p>
            During my time at a company, I faced an ethical dilemma when my
            employer asked me to continue developing a project for a client,
            which was covered by a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). The client
            had invested significant resources in developing the project
            independently, and proceeding would have breached our agreement. I
            had to weigh values like integrity, professional responsibility, and
            the company's reputation. After careful thought, I decided to
            decline the directive, explaining to my employer the importance of
            honoring our commitment to the client. Looking back, I feel proud of
            that decision because it reinforced my commitment to ethical
            professionalism and has shaped how I approach similar dilemmas. As a
            young mother, I want to set a good example for my daughter. I want
            her to learn to make decisions that aren't just easy, but are the
            right ones for those around her. It's important to me that I show
            her that doing what's right matters, even when it's tough. By making
            ethical decisions in my own life, I hope to guide her toward a
            future where she can trust her own values, no matter the situation.
          </p>
          <h3>
            The influence of my culture and the people around me in shaping my
            values and identity.
          </h3>
          <p>
            My culture and the people around me have had a considerable
            influence on my values. Growing up, I was taught that honesty and
            responsibility are non-negotiable. This has shaped the way I
            approach both personal and professional situations. I have always
            been encouraged to do what's right, even when it is difficult, and
            that value has become a core part of my identity.
          </p>
          <h3>
            My strengths and how they will support me during my learning
            journey.
          </h3>
          <p>
            When it comes to strengths, I believe that my problem-solving
            ability and adaptability will help me on my learning journey. I have
            always been able to stay calm in the face of challenges and find
            ways to move forward, and I think that will allow me to thrive as I
            learn new things. I'm also a quick learner, which helps me absorb
            new information and tackle complex ideas efficiently.
          </p>
          <h3>
            My limitations in terms of learning and career development and how
            they might affect my learning journey.
          </h3>
          <p>
            I recognize that my impatience can be a limitation at times. I tend
            to want quick results, which sometimes makes it harder for me to
            fully absorb and reflect on complex topics. I'm aware of this, and
            it's something I'm working on. Being patient with the process will
            help me become more effective in both learning and career
            development.
          </p>
          <h3>
            An example of when I tried to work productively with others, but
            there was resistance or tension. The strategies I tried at the time,
            how effective they were, and my reflections on what other strategies
            I would try now and why.
          </h3>
          <p>
            I've also worked in situations where there was some resistance or
            tension while collaborating with others. One example was when we had
            differing opinions on how to approach a project. I tried open
            communication and compromise, but there was still some tension. In
            hindsight, I think I could have focused more on empathy and
            listening to others' viewpoints. By ensuring everyone feels heard, I
            believe we could have worked through the tension more smoothly and
            reached a better outcome. If I were to face a similar situation
            again, I'd focus more on these strategies to foster a more
            collaborative and understanding environment.
