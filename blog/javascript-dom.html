          <h2>JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</h2>
          <h3><u class="sub-head">JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</u></h3>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a powerful language that is lightweight and can
            communicate with the browser.JavaScript programs should be stored in
            and delivered as .js files. Javascript is different from
            "Java".JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are the foundational technologies
            for building websites.JavaScript is like the soul of the human
            body.HTML and CSS are the body and the appearance. JS brings the
            body to life!. Using the analogy of switchboard and wiring, we could
            understand how they work together.
          </p>
          <p>
            * <strong>HTML</strong> is the <strong>The Switchboard</strong>. It
            is the physical structure where switches, buttons, and labels are
            placed. It represents the content and structure of the webpage.The
            buttons and bulb are like the physical components on a switchboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            * <strong>CSS</strong> is the design of the Switchboard.It
            determines its appearance. how the wires and switches look and makes
            it visually appealing.Basically a user-friendly Switchboard design.
          </p>
          <p>
            * <strong>JavaScript</strong> is doing the wiring functionality. It
            enables the switches to perform actions like turning the light bulb
            on or off. These wires connect buttons to the bulb, without it the
            switchboard would just be a static display, making it functional.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly,Remote and TV do too. The TV represents the structure like
            HTML does. Design of the TV determines its style, that is our CSS.
            Javascript is the Remote Control, which allows you to interact with
            the TV.It connects the remote to the TV , enabling functionality
            like turning it on, off, and adjusting the volume.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can find elements by class name and by ID using . and #, respectively (just like with CSS), or by combining these methods, for example:

If we wanted to find the first element with the 'w3schools-tutorial' id we would use: document.querySelector('#w3schools-tutorial')

If we wanted to find the first <a> element with the 'w3schools-tutorial' id we would use: document.querySelector('a#w3schools-tutorial')
See the difference? We've got an 'a' in front of the '#' to indicate that we only care about <a> elements.

If we wanted a list of all elements with the 'dom' class we would use: document.querySelectorAll('.dom')
          </p>

          <h3><u class="sub-head">DOM and an example of how you might interact with it</u></h3>
          <p>
            The <strong>Document Object Model <em>(DOM)</em></strong
            >, generally abbreviated to DOM, is the way through which JavaScript
            interacts with content within a website.The DOM is not a programming
            language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any
            model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and
            their component parts.The DOM is not part of the JavaScript
            language, but is instead a Web API used to build websites. For example, Node.js
            runs JavaScript programs on a computer, but provides a different set
            of APIs, and the DOM API is not a core part of the Node.js runtime.
          </p>
          <p>
            What your browser displays is a web document.what you see is a
            collision of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript working together to create
            what gets shown.Digging one step deeper, under the covers, there is
            a hierarchical structure that your browser uses to make sense of
            everything going on.Browsers provide a document JavaScript object with a
             large number of properties and methods to allow us to do precisely this. 
             It's a "tree" of objects, with JS objects representing the head, body, title, paragraphs, etc. 
             It's like a family tree, except each object, method, or property has only one parent.

            At the head of this tree-the great-great-great-grandparent of all the 
            rest, so to speak - the original ancestor - is the window object, and inside the window 
            object is the document object, which represents our page. 
          </p>
          <div class="image-idclass dom-img">
            <img src="/assets/dom.png" alt="Example dom" class="dom-example" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Everything that makes up your DOM is more generically known as
            nodes.These nodes can be elements (which shouldn't surprise you),
            attributes, text content, comments, document-related stuff, and
            various other things you simply never think about. That detail is
            important to someone, but that "someone" shouldn't be you and me.
            Almost always, the only kind of node we will care about is the
            element kind because that is what we will be dealing with 99% of the
            time. The document object does not simply represent a read-only
            version of the HTML document. It is a two-way street where you can
            read as well as manipulate your document at will
          </p>
          <h4>Example of Interacting with the DOM</h4>
          <p>
            Imagine you have a web page with a button that changes the
            background color of a specific when clicked.
          </p>
          <div class="image-idclass dom-img">
            <img
              src="/assets/dom-html.png"
              alt="Example dom"
              class="dom-example"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="image-idclass dom-img">
            <img
              src="/assets/js-dom.png"
              alt="Example dom"
              class="dom-example"
            />
          </div>

          <h3><u class="sub-head">difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</u></h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              An <strong>array</strong> is a special variable, which can hold
              more than one value. An array can hold many values under a single
              name, and you can access the values by referring to an index
              number.Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a
              JavaScript Array.The length property of an array returns the
              length of an array. Syntax: const array_name = [item1, item2,
              ...];
            </p>
            <p>const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Array indexes start with 0</strong>. [0] is the first element. [1] is the
              second element.The JavaScript method toString() converts an array
              to a string of (comma separated) array values.
            </p>
            <p>
              const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
              document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits.toString();
            </p>
            <p>
              With JavaScript, the full array can be accessed by referring to
              the array name.
            </p>
            <p>
              const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
              document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars;
            </p>
            <p>
              The length property is always one more than the highest array
              index.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Arrays are ordered collections of data (indexed numerically).
              </li>
              <li>const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];</li>
              <li>console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: apple</li>
              <li>console.log(fruits[1]); // Output: banana</li>
              <li>Arrays are best when you need to store lists of similar data or when the order of items matters.</li>
            </ul>
          
          
          <p><strong>Objects: </strong> data type containing unordered (but labeled) key/value pairs, stored within curly brackets {}. 
            Each 'key' acts as a label for the corresponding 'value'.

            Key/value pairs are referred to together as a 'property'.
          </p> <p>
            const popcorn = {
              foodType: 'movie snack',
              price: 4.99,
              flavour: 'salt'
            }</p>
            Above, popcorn is the name of the object. foodType is a 'key', 'movie snack' is a 'value', 
            and together this key/value pair is referred to as a 'property'.
            
            There are multiple ways to access or edit data from inside of an object. One common way to
            retrieve data from an object is by using dot notation, where we say the name of the object, 
            followed by a dot and then the key we would like to access. For example if we wanted to know the price of 
            popcorn we could use popcorn.price, which provides the value of 4.99. While popcorn.flavour would provide the value of 'salt'.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Objects are unordered collections of key-value pairs.</li>
        <li><strong>Dot notation: object.key</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Bracket notation: object["key"]</strong></li>
        <li>const car = { brand: "Toyota", model: "Corolla", year: 2020 };</li>
        <li>console.log(car.brand);      // Output: Toyota (dot notation)</li>
        <li>console.log(car["model"]);   // Output: Corolla (bracket notation)</li>
        <li> Objects are better for storing related data with descriptive keys (e.g., properties of an entity).</li>
       </ul>
          </div>
      
        <h3><u class="sub-head">What functions are and why they are helpful</u></h3>
        <p>A function is a block of <strong>reusable code</strong> designed to perform a specific task. 
          Functions take inputs (optional), process them, and return an output (optional).After declaring/writing a function,
           you'll want to use that function! Do that by 'calling' it. 
           You call a function by writing its name, followed by brackets (). functions do not run without calling them.
          
        </p>
        <p>
          Function keyword, followed by an identifier/name of the function, then brackets which optionally contain parameters separated by commas, then curly brackets inside of which is the statement(s) that define the function.
          A piece of code typically used to execute a task, written so that it can be called upon multiple times if needed.
        </p>
        <p>Features of functions are:-</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Reusability:</strong> It allow us to reuse the same code multiple times. It helps to avoid code duplication.
            That means, It overcome the repetition problem.
          </li>
          <li>Avoid Repetition (DRY Principle)</li>
          <li>
            Parameters and Return Values : you can pass inputs into functions and receive outputs, It makes them flexible and powerful.

          </li>
          <li>
            Maintability: It's easy to debug and understand. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        </div>
