          <h2><u class="sub-head">Te Whare Tapa Whā</u></h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Te Whare Tapa Whā</strong> is a model of the 4 dimensions of wellbeing.The
            model describes health and wellbeing as a wharenui/meeting house
            with 4 walls. When we look after all 4 aspects, we look after our
            hauora/wellbeing. Checking in on the 4 pillars helps us balance our
            hauora and support others to balance theirs, too.
          </p>
          <ul>
            These walls represent:
            <li><strong>taha wairua</strong> - spiritual wellbeing</li>
            <li><strong>taha hinengaro</strong> - mental and emotional wellbeing</li>
            <li><strong>taha tinana</strong> - physical wellbeing</li>
            <li><strong>taha whānau</strong> - family and social wellbeing.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Our connection with the whenua/land forms the foundation.</p>
          <p>
            When all these things are in balance, we thrive. When one or more of
            these is out of balance our wellbeing is impacted.

            By nurturing and strengthening all 5 dimensions, you support your
            health and wellbeing, as well as the health and wellbeing of your
            whānau.
          </p>
          <h3><u class="sub-head">Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing)</u></h3>
<p>Taha tinana is your physical wellbeing. It is about how your body grows, feels and moves, and how you care for it.</p>
        <p>Nourishing and strengthening your physical wellbeing helps you to cope with the ups and downs and life.
          Sometimes your tinana might not be where you'd like it to be and this 
          might be beyond your control. What's important is that you do what 
          you can to nurture it.
</p>
Some key things to take care of taha tinana are physical activity, healthy eating,
and good sleep hygiene.
Feeling physically well helps you feel mentally well.</p>
<p>
  <h3><u class="sub-head">Taha Hinengaro (emotional and mental wellbeing)
  </u></h3>
  <p>Taha hinengaro is your mind, heart, conscience, thoughts and feelings. It's about how you feel, as well as how you communicate and think. Taking care of taha hinengaro is important for everyone,
     regardless of whether or not you've experienced mental illness or distress.</p>
<p>The foods we eat can affect our mental health, physical activity can reduce symptoms of stress and anxiety, 
  and learning how to manage stress before it gets overwhelming are all ways to support taha hinengaro.
  Keep your mind active with things like learning karakia/prayer, waiata/music or mau rākau/Māori weaponry. Try reading some pūrākau/stories or whakapapa about your ancestors or the days of old. Tune in to some of the
   online wānanga/workshops available such as learning te reo Māori. </p>
   <h3><u class="sub-head">Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing)
  </u></h3>
  <p>Taha wairua explores your relationship with the environment, people and heritage in the past, present and future.

    The way people view wairua can be very different. For some, wairua is the capacity for faith or religious
     beliefs or having a belief in a higher power. Others may describe wairua as an internal connection to the universe.
      There is no right or wrong way to think of or experience wairua, but it is an important part of our mental wellbeing.</p>
   <p>Find ways to keep your spirits high. Listen to uplifting waiata/music, attend online karakia sessions, soak up the rays of the sun or listen to native manu/birds like tui or ruru.</p>
   <h3><u class="sub-head">Taha Whānau (family wellbeing)
  </u></h3>
  <p>Taha whānau is about who makes you feel you belong, who you care about and who you share your life with.

    Whānau is about extended relationships - not just immediate relatives. It's your hoamahi/colleagues, friends, community and the people you care about. You have a unique place and a role to full within your whānau and your whānau contributes to your wellbeing and identity.
    
    Keeping in touch is so important. Send aroha from afar by holding regular online or phone catch ups with your whānau and kaumatua. Connect more with whānau and friends kanohi ki te kanohi/face-to-face. </p>
  <p>Spending time with whānau, doing things for them and getting involved gives you a feeling of purpose, connection and wellbeing. It benefits you and strengthens your whānau. As a core source of strength, support, security and identity, whānau plays a central role in your wellbeing.</p>
  <h3><u class="sub-head">Whenua (connection with the land or environment)
  </u></h3>
  <p>Whenua is the place where you stand. It is your connection to the land - a source of life, nourishment and wellbeing for everyone. Whenua includes soil, rocks, plants, animals and people - the tangata whenua. We are linked physically and spiritually to the land - it is the earth through which you are connected to your tūpuna/ancestors and all the generations that will come after you.

    You can also think about whenua as your place of belonging - that means the spaces where you feel comfortable, safe and able to be yourself. It could be around your friends, at home with whānau, as part of a sports team or even at your place of study or mahi/work.When was the last time you took a moment to enjoy nature? Not just the bush, mountains or beach but the small, everyday wonders all around us – the rustling of the wind through the trees, the spring flowers or the sound of birds settling for the night.</p>
