            <h2>My Learning Plan</h2>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              My long-term goal is to establish myself in the tech industry as a
              Software Engineer in New Zealand. I aspire not only to build
              impactful and diverse projects but also to contribute to
              collaborative teamwork and foster a supportive work environment.
              Additionally, I aim to grow both technically and professionally in
              my career.My strengths include my drive to succeed, patience and
              persistence in growing my capabilities, Eventhough i have
              limitations of reflecting my own thoughts or sharing insights.
              While at dev academy I would like to develop my technical skills
              and soft skills. These include building confidence in presenting
              and communicating effectively with facilitators and peers.I want
              to structure my learning at dev academy as a solid foundation for
              continuous development and evolve alongside changing technologies
              and development stacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m empathetic and naturally prefer listening more than speaking,
              which helps me understand situations before responding
              thoughtfully. I aim to apply this approach when working
              collaboratively with others. To stay productive, I plan to
              allocate my available time efficiently, balancing my program tasks
              with family responsibilities to ensure I don’t fall behind.I’ll
              lean on my family for support when the workload builds up. Because
              I have a baby of 11 month. Keeping them informed about my tasks
              allows them to step in and provide reassurance when needed. I’ll
              also focus on taking short breaks, realigning my priorities, and
              asking for help, if necessary, to regain control of the situation.
              I will use the program’s communication channels to seek help
              whenever needed. I’m committed to reaching out promptly to
              facilitators, peers, or other support networks without hesitation,
              ensuring I stay on track and address any challenges early.
            </p>
            <p>
              I expect clear guidance, regular check-ins, and constructive
              feedback encouraging growth. Knowing their support gives me the
              confidence to tackle challenges and make the most of this learning
              experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              My family and I are fully aware of the program’s requirements, and
              I’ve planned to meet them. My husband and extended family are
              prepared to provide support when needed. While unforeseen
              challenges may arise, I aim to adapt quickly and ensure my
              progress remains uninterrupted.
