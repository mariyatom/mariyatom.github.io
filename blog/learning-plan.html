                My long-term goal is to build my career in the software
                development industry in New Zealand. Alongside working on
                projects, I aspire to contribute effectively to a team and
                foster a supportive team environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope to apply the skills I gain from Dev Academy in real-world
                scenarios, developing user-friendly applications that positively
                impact people's lives. Nothing brings me more joy than seeing
                people use and benefit from an app I have developed.
              </p>
              <p>
                By the time I leave Dev Academy, I want to have strengthened my
                confidence in communication both listening and speaking, refined
                my problem-solving skills, and improved my ability to
                collaborate effectively within a team.

              <p>
                My biggest strength is my perseverance and aspiration to become
                an effective, competent, and employable developer. I am
                committed to continuously improving my skills and adapting to
                new challenges.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, my biggest limitation is that, despite completing the
                last six weeks of Foundations, I still struggle with imposter
                syndrome, which I may carry with me as someone who has recently
                immigrated to New Zealand.

              <p>
                One of my biggest non-technical challenges will be improving my
                listening skills. I sometimes find it difficult to fully grasp
                and understand different accents and speech patterns, which can
                affect my ability to engage in discussions and absorb
                information effectively. This is an area I am actively working
                on to enhance my communication and comprehension skills. By
                practicing active listening, seeking clarification when needed,
                and exposing myself to diverse accents, I aim to overcome this
                challenge and communicate more confidently throughout Bootcamp.

                At Dev Academy, I would like to focus on developing my
                communication skills, particularly in articulating my thoughts
                clearly and confidently in group discussions. Since effective
                teamwork is essential in a collaborative environment, I want to
                work seamlessly within the team by active listening,
                contributing meaningfully and support to my peers.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe that, feedback is a most crucial part of growth. I
                want to develop the ability to accept and provide it in a polite
                way.

              <p>
                I expect myself to stay disciplined,committed and proactive
                throughout my learning journey. I want to maintain growth
                mentality and embracing mistakes as a learning opportunities
                rather than setbacks.
              </p>
              <p>
                I will push myself to step outside my comfort zone, especially
                in areas like communication and teamwork. I love to sort out
                things myself, even if I ensure, don't get stuck for too long.
                If I can't resolve a task in reasonable time, I will reach out
                to my peers and seek facilitator support also.I would like to
                work actively on contributing to discussions, collaborating with
                my peers, and being open to feedback.

                My long-term goal is to establish myself in the tech industry as
                a Software Engineer in New Zealand. I aspire not only to build
                impactful and diverse projects but also to contribute to
                collaborative teamwork and foster a supportive work environment.
                Additionally, I aim to grow both technically and professionally
                in my career.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm fortunate to have a supportive family, which motivates me to
                focus on learning. My strengths include my drive to succeed,
                patience and persistence in growing my capabilities, even though
                I have limitations in reflecting on my own thoughts or sharing
                insights. While at dev academy I would like to develop my
                technical skills and soft skills. These include building
                confidence in presenting and communicating effectively with
                facilitators and peers.I want to structure my learning at dev
                academy as a solid foundation for continuous development and
                evolve alongside changing technologies and development stacks.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm empathetic and naturally prefer listening more than
                speaking, which helps me understand situations before responding
                thoughtfully. I aim to apply this approach when working
                collaboratively with others. To stay productive, I plan to
                allocate my available time efficiently, balancing my program
                tasks with family responsibilities to ensure I don't fall
                behind.I'll lean on my family for support when the workload
                builds up. Because I have a baby of 11 month. Keeping them
                informed about my tasks allows them to step in and provide
                reassurance when needed. I'll also focus on taking short breaks,
                realigning my priorities, and asking for help, if necessary, to
                regain control of the situation. I will use the program's
                communication channels to seek help whenever needed. I'm
                committed to reaching out promptly to facilitators, peers, or
                other support networks without hesitation, ensuring I stay on
                track and address any challenges early.
              </p>
              <p>
                I expect clear guidance, regular check-ins, and constructive
                feedback encouraging growth. Knowing their support gives me the
                confidence to tackle challenges and make the most of this
                learning experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                My family and I are fully aware of the program's requirements,
                and I've planned to meet them. My husband and extended family
                are prepared to provide support when needed. While unforeseen
                challenges may arise, I aim to adapt quickly and ensure my
                progress remains uninterrupted.
